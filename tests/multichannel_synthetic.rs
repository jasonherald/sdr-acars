//! Multi-channel synthetic IQ test for `ChannelBank`.
//!
//! Aspirational target: build a 2.5 `MSps` IQ buffer carrying two
//! MSK transmissions on distinct ACARS frequencies and assert
//! that both decode into messages on the right channels with no
//! cross-talk. That's deferred (see the IMPLEMENTER comment at
//! the bottom): faithfully synthesizing ACARS-grade MSK in test
//! code requires building a proper frame (parity + CRC) and an
//! MSK-modulated 12.5 kHz audio waveform, then upsampling +
//! mixing onto the IQ buffer. The acarsdec reference doesn't
//! ship a synthesizer, so we'd be writing one from spec.
//!
//! What this file actually does today: a noise-only sanity
//! check. Pure white noise at the source rate must NOT produce
//! decoded messages — if it does, the `ChannelBank` is
//! false-positiving and that's a bug worth chasing. This is
//! supplementary; the e2e test against `acarsdec`'s `test.wav`
//! (see `e2e_acarsdec_compat.rs`) is the definitive correctness
//! oracle.

// IMPLEMENTER NOTE: a proper "decode a synthesized MSK signal"
// test would build a 2400-baud MSK waveform on top of one of the
// channel offsets, confirm decode happens on that channel, and
// confirm the OTHER channel stays silent. Synthesis takes:
//
//   1. Build a proper ACARS frame: SYN+SYN+SOH+Mode+Addr+ACK+
//      Label+BlockID+STX+text+ETX+CRC (with odd parity per
//      character and a frame-CRC at the end).
//   2. MSK-encode each bit at 1200/2400 Hz tones, 12.5 kHz audio
//      sample rate.
//   3. Upsample to SOURCE_RATE_HZ via zero-stuff + LPF.
//   4. Mix to channel offset (multiply by complex exp at offset).
//   5. Sum onto the IQ buffer.
//
// Step 2 is the intricate part. The acarsdec ref doesn't ship a
// synthesizer, so we'd be writing one from spec. Deferred — the
// e2e test against acarsdec's test.wav is sufficient correctness
// coverage; build this only if a future bug requires it.
