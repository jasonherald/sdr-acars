//! Multi-block ACARS message reassembly.
//!
//! ACARS frames longer than ~220 bytes split across multiple
//! blocks. Non-final blocks end with the ETB byte (0x17), the
//! final block ends with ETX (0x03). Block IDs sequence
//! per-aircraft per-message-no — the same `(aircraft,
//! message_no)` pair identifies "blocks of the same logical
//! message". Within a pair, block IDs increase (`1`, `2`, …
//! ending on ETX).
//!
//! An earlier viewer iteration displayed each block as its own
//! row with the block ID shown — readable, but noisy on long
//! messages. This module reassembles a stream of
//! frames into a single logical message per `(aircraft,
//! message_no)` key:
//!
//! - **ETB block** ([`AcarsMessage::end_of_message`] = `false`):
//!   parked in a pending bucket keyed on `(aircraft,
//!   message_no)`. Concatenation is deferred until ETX.
//! - **ETX block** ([`AcarsMessage::end_of_message`] = `true`):
//!   any pending blocks for the same key are sorted by
//!   `block_id`, concatenated to the ETX block's text, and
//!   emitted as a single reassembled message with
//!   [`AcarsMessage::reassembled_block_count`] set to N.
//! - **Timeout**: pending entries older than
//!   [`REASSEMBLY_TIMEOUT`] (30 s) at observation time are
//!   emitted as best-effort partial reassemblies (their text
//!   alone, with `end_of_message = false` preserved). Avoids
//!   leaking RAM for messages whose ETX never arrives.
//!
//! Messages without a `message_no` (e.g. some uplinks, link
//! tests) are pass-through: they can't be reassembled because
//! we have no key to group them. Messages that arrive ETX-only
//! (single-block, `block_id = 1`, `end_of_message = true`) are
//! also pass-through — no pending blocks to merge.
//!
//! # Out-of-order handling
//!
//! Real-world ACARS over the air can deliver blocks out of
//! order — atmospheric fades, channel hopping at the airline's
//! ground network. The assembler accepts blocks in arbitrary
//! arrival order and sorts by `block_id` at emission time; the
//! ETX block doesn't need to arrive last (it's identified by
//! `end_of_message`, not by position).
//!
//! # Pure / no GTK / no I/O
//!
//! `MessageAssembler` is a plain owning state machine. Time is
//! provided by the caller via `observe(msg, now)` so this stays
//! testable without a clock. The DSP-side caller passes
//! `SystemTime::now()`; CLI tools that replay fixtures pass the
//! frame's own `timestamp`.
